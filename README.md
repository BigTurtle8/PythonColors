# PythonColors
Easy color setting for python.

INSTRUCTIONS

Simply create a class Colors. Then, when you want to set the color of something that will be printed to console, use Colors.set_color(). 

NOTE: If you import * from Colors.py, then you do not need to create a Colors class. Simply use c.set_color()

I hope this can make your console pop out!
